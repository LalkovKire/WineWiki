# WineWiki
This is a full stack project envisioned as an ecommerce platform. <br>

----------------------------------
### Backend 
Make sure you install the dependencies, since the project is using maven, open the pom file and click install.<br>
The project is using postgresql so make sure you have installed postgresql on your pc. <br>
Connect to your local postgresql, and make a new scheme called WineWiki.<br>
Change the credentials in application-prod.properties file. <br>

I've already setted up a data initalizer for first time setup to fill up the database which will run once the project starts.
